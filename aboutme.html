    <h1 id="h1About">About me</h1>
    <p id="welcome">👋 Heyyyy! So glad you are here</p>
    <p id="aboutMeContent">
      I’m Marcos Blanco, a former healthcare professional turned tech
      enthusiast, currently diving deep into the world of software development
      and game design. Originally from Brazil 🇧🇷, where I earned my Bachelor’s
      in Dentistry and a Master’s in Orthodontics 🦷, I’ve always enjoyed
      helping people through precision and creativity—qualities that I now bring
      to my work in technology.<br /><br />
      Now based in Vancouver 🇨🇦, and pursuing a Computer Science 💻 degree at
      Langara College , I’m excited to grow my skills in programming, game
      development, and app creation. My portfolio showcases a few projects I’ve
      built to explore the possibilities of
      <span style="color: #6a0dad; font-weight: bold">JavaScript</span>,
      <span style="color: #6a0dad; font-weight: bold">C#</span>,
      <span style="color: #6a0dad; font-weight: bold">Python</span> and
      frameworks like
      <span style="color: #6a0dad; font-weight: bold">React</span> and
      <span style="color: #6a0dad; font-weight: bold">Unity</span>. I’m
      passionate about creating interactive, user-focused applications and games
      that offer unique and engaging experiences.<br /><br />I approach this
      journey with humility, fully aware that I have a long path ahead. Every
      line of code teaches me something new, and I embrace each challenge as an
      opportunity to grow. While there’s much to learn, I’m committed to pushing
      forward, honing my skills, and contributing wherever I can. I know that
      technology is where I belong, and I’m excited for the road ahead—one
      project, one lesson, one breakthrough at a time.<br /><br />
      When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me gaming, working out, or
      exploring new places. I believe in the power of learning, adaptability,
      and combining creativity with code to build meaningful projects. Thank you
      for visiting my portfolio—I'm excited to connect and collaborate on future
      projects!
